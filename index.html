<p>Economics is a way of thinking that provides insights into all facets of our personal and professional lives, improving our understanding of the world and our own decision-making. </p>
<p>Economics is oriented around solving real-world  problems â€” not merely memorizing facts. This helps to build valuable critical thinking skills and methods of analysis. </p>
<p>The economic way of thinking is invaluable in  making sound decisions in any type of organization, and provides the foundation for many other academic and professional disciplines, such as management, marketing and finance. </p>

<p>The Department of Economics provides a rigorous training that is valuable in the competitive labor market and a strong basis for graduate studies in business, law and the social sciences.</p>
