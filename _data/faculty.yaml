Recent research projects include the development of software based analysis techniques designed to assess the elements of an inverse Jacobian matrix based upon a nonparametric specification of the Jacobian matrix. The computer programs apply mathematical results derived separately on the stability and invertibility of matrices as related to characteristics of their signed directed graphs. Applications of the results have been found in computer model quality control and the evaluation of econometric models."
