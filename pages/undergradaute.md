The major in economics will expose you to the economist's way of thinking about social problems and behavior.

Our BA program provides the essential background for study of economics at the graduate level and is designed for those who are planning for careers in economics, as well as professional careers. This program is also good preparation for those looking to pursue a career in law or business. Through the cooperative education option, students may earn income while gaining valuable work experience which can enhance their job market prospects upon graduation. By completing an academic research project under the guidance of a faculty member, co-op students may earn credit for ECON 3581.

Pending approval, students who wish to earn a BA and an MA in economics may do so in a combined 4+1 program. Students begin graduate study during their undergraduate program and are able to count some electives towards both degrees. This program is only open to students who will complete both degrees in a total of five years. See the economics faculty advisor if you are considering this option.

## Enter The Job Market on a Positive Note

Economics majors earn higher income than other majors. Recent research by Assistant Professor Douglas Webber  indicates that the economics major provides the  second-highest expected lifetime earnings of all majors.

Economics majors have diverse career opportunities,  including those in financial services, consulting, healthcare,  government and international organizations.  

Job prospects for economics majors are growing as more and more organizations hire economists to study and interpret the complex global economy and analyze “big data” – the wealth of newly available information on consumer behavior and other activity in the economy.

## Prepare For Graduate Work

Economics is excellent preparation for graduate school, and is widely considered to be one of the best degrees for students interested in pursuing a professional degree in business or law.

## Research Opportunities

Students seeking research experience may work directly  with specific faculty members or through the Center for  Regional Economics at Temple. Student interns perform research relating to economic issues in the Delaware Valley under the supervision of Temple professors and professional economists.
