## Where Can a Major in Economics Take You?
Graduates with an undergraduate major in economics, whether it’s the liberal arts or the business major, are prepared for a broad spectrum of jobs in business, economic consulting and government. Economics courses emphasize using an orderly way of thinking about and solving problems that arise from having to make choices in situations that are beyond an individual’s direct experience. The abstract reasoning skills that are practiced in economics are highly valued where choosing efficiently in coordination with others is important. Everyone has to have the same basic problem-solving approach and economic training provides that.

A major problem that companies face is having to earn at least enough to cover their costs. That means they have to have people at managerial levels who are focused on increasing revenues or decreasing cost. These managers need to be able to operate on their own using a common framework so that their decisions are compatible with those of others in the company. In business, that common framework is the economic decision-making framework.

Similarly, in government, managers are required to achieve as much as they can with their limited budgets. And economic consulting firms bring specialized problem-solving skills that are beyond the capabilities of individual companies or government agencies.

## BA in Economics
The major in economics exposes a student to the economist’s way of thinking about social problems and behavior. The major helps a student understand the economic aspects of current events and public policy, and it’s a good preparation for careers in public policy, law and business. It also provides the essential background for study of economics and is designed for those who are planning for careers in economics, among other liberal arts fields as well as professional careers. Students acquire a general business background and get a  specialized exposure to economics.

## BA in Mathematical Economics
The interdisciplinary mathematical economics program is a platform for systematic concentration in the mathematical approach to economics. This degree is offered in both CLA and the College of Science and Technology-CST. The mathematical economics curriculum provides a broad selection of courses that cover all important areas of economics and the mathematical tools required for a critical, deep mastery of these areas. This program is especially recommended for those students who intend to pursue graduate studies in economics.
