The major in economics will expose you to the economist's way of thinking about social problems and behavior.

Our BA program provides the essential background for study of economics at the graduate level and is designed for those who are planning for careers in economics, as well as professional careers. This program is also good preparation for those looking to pursue a career in law or business. Through the cooperative education option, students may earn income while gaining valuable work experience which can enhance their job market prospects upon graduation. By completing an academic research project under the guidance of a faculty member, co-op students may earn credit for ECON 3581.

Pending approval, students who wish to earn a BA and an MA in economics may do so in a combined 4+1 program. Students begin graduate study during their undergraduate program and are able to count some electives towards both degrees. This program is only open to students who will complete both degrees in a total of five years. See the economics faculty advisor if you are considering this option.

## Enter The Job Market on a Positive Note

Economics majors earn higher income than other majors. Recent research by Assistant Professor Douglas Webber  indicates that the economics major provides the  second-highest expected lifetime earnings of all majors.

Economics majors have diverse career opportunities,  including those in financial services, consulting, healthcare,  government and international organizations.  

Job prospects for economics majors are growing as more and more organizations hire economists to study and interpret the complex global economy and analyze “big data” – the wealth of newly available information on consumer behavior and other activity in the economy.

## Prepare For Graduate Work

Economics is excellent preparation for graduate school, and is widely considered to be one of the best degrees for students interested in pursuing a professional degree in business or law.

## Research Opportunities

Students seeking research experience may work directly  with specific faculty members or through the Center for  Regional Economics at Temple. Student interns perform research relating to economic issues in the Delaware Valley under the supervision of Temple professors and professional economists.

## Program Overview

The major in economics exposes a student to the economist's way of thinking about social problems and behavior. The major helps a student understand the economic aspects of current events and public policy and it is a good preparation for careers in public policy, law and business.  The BA major, which also provides the essential background for study of economics, is designed for those who are planning for careers in economics, among other Liberal Arts fields, as well as professional careers. The BBA major is offered to students who want to acquire a general business background in addition to specialized exposure to economics.

## Degrees and Programs of Study

Economics Major in the College of Liberal Arts (CLA)

The BA major, which also provides the essential background for study of Economics at the graduate level, is designed for those who are planning for careers in Economics, among other Liberal Arts fields, as well as professional careers in law and medicine.

## Mathematical Economics Major (offered in both CLA and the College of Science and Technology-CST)

The Departments of Economics and Mathematics offer the interdisciplinary Mathematical Economics program as a platform for systematic concentration in the mathematical approach to economics. Economics has progressed in the last several decades by making extensive use of mathematical techniques. As a result, students who wish to pursue graduate study in economics, finance, accounting and other disciplines that make an extensive use of economics need a thorough grounding in both economics and mathematics. The Mathematical Economics curriculum provides this grounding with a broad selection of courses that cover all important areas of economics and the mathematical tools required for a critical, deep mastery of these areas. This program is especially recommended for those students who intend to pursue graduate studies in Economics.

## Economics Major in the Fox School of Business (Fox)
The BBA major is offered to students who want to acquire a general business background in addition to specialized exposure to Economics. The grid for a three-year BBA can be found here.

## Economics Minor in CLA
The CLA minor is designed for students majoring in other subjects who want more exposure to Economics than would be covered in the two introductory Economics courses.

## Economics Minor in Business (Fox)
The Fox minor is designed for students who are interested in Economics, but majoring in another CLA field, and want a basic business education as a preparation for pursuing a business career or getting an MBA.

## Certificates

The Management Career Certificate is designed for students who do not wish to pursue an Economics  or Fox major or minor, but want some recognition for having taken courses that are a useful basis for preparing for a career in business or the non-profit sector
The Political Economy Certificate is designed for CLA students who want recognition for having been exposed to the two related fields of Economics and Political Science.  It is particularly useful for students planning a career in law, public policy, or international affairs.

## Honors

The Economics Department offers honors versions of two introductory economics courses:  Economics 1901, Honors Macroeconomic Principles, and 1902, Honors Microeconomic Principles.
