## Internships/Opportunities
Economics Majors have access to internship opportunities through the Economics student organization, The Economics Society (TES). Information on TES is available on their [website](https://econclub.wordpress.com). You can contact them at: [econclub@temple.edu](mailto:econclub@temple.edu)

### Project-based Internships
Projects allow an intern to apply economic principles to everyday organizational and business problems.  Businesses need to grow to survive and projects are a focused way to build the economic platform that ensures that growth and sustainability. Visit the [Economics Project Based Internship Program website](https://sites.temple.edu/economicsinternships/) for information on how to engage in a project with an organization that is striving to grow.

### Bureau of Labor Statistics Internships
The economists from the Bureau of Labor Statistics ("BLS") teach our interns all about the data and statistics collected and reported by the BLS. This includes data on unemployment, inflation and wages. Interns learn how to utilize and interpret this data and will create a research project and presentation based on BLS data. The BLS Internship meets once per week on the main Temple campus.

### First Up Internships
First Up supports and advocates for Pre-Kindergarten providers in the City of Philadelphia. There are approximately 3,000 of these private Pre-K providers in Philadelphia. Interns will be trained by First Up to aid these Pre-K providers in creating operating budgets and in finding additional sources of revenue. Additionally, Interns can participate in research programs that support the lobbying efforts of First Up. The First Up Internship has regular meetings at their offices in Center City.
