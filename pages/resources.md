## Opportunities and Compensation in Economics

### Earnings of Economics Majors in Perspective
Your undergraduate major has a huge influence on your career. Associate Professor [Douglas Webber](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/webber-douglas) has recently published research on the earnings of about 80 different college majors. Data from the 2010 U.S. Census tells us that economics majors have some of the best compensated careers. The table below shows a comparison of compensation data for a few selected majors to put this claim in perspective. The data comes from the Wall Street Journal and is based on the report [What’s it Worth](https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/whats-it-worth-the-economic-value-of-college-majors/) by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.

Major field unemployment, first 25% earnings, median earnings, top 75% earnings.

- Computer science: 5.6%	$50,000	$77,000	$102,000
- ECONOMICS: 6.3%	$42,000	$69,000	$108,000
- Finance:	4.5%	$44,000	$65,000	$101,000
- Mathematics:	5.0%	$42,000	$63,000	$95,000
- Accounting:	5.4%	$41,000	$61,000	$94,000
- Marketing:	5.9%	$40,000	$59,000	$90,000
- Political Science:	6.0%	$38,000	$57,000	$91,000
- International Business:	8.5%	$38,000	$52,000	$87,000

A complementary view on the career prospects of economics majors is seen in data from a U.S. News article.

U.S. News reports the following numbers, according to salary data from PayScale:

### Field Starting Pay and Median Mid-Career Pay
- Government: $41,400- $87,300
- Political Science: $39,900- $80,100
- International Relations: $40,500- $79,400
- Advertising:  $37,700- $74,700

### Most Popular College Degrees Earned By Millionaires
- Pay by major from [CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/2006/02/13/pf/college/starting_salaries/index.htm).
- People making up the top 1% in earnings from the [New York Times](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/what-the-top-1-of-earners-majored-in/).
