The study of economics is excellent preparation for a wide range of careers. Economics majors with bachelor’s degrees are well prepared to be managers and leaders in both the public and private sectors. Training in economics at the undergraduate level also provides a solid basis for professional study in law, business, public administration, and the health sciences. College graduates who majored in economics rank highly in terms of compensation nationally.

There are numerous internship opportunities available for economics students in the Philadelphia region, including:

- Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce
- Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank
- Leading mutual fund, brokerage and consulting firms

## Careers

Graduates with an undergraduate major in economics, whether it is the liberal arts or the business major, will find that it has prepared them for a broad spectrum of jobs in business, economic consulting and government.  The reason is that courses in economics emphasize using an orderly way of thinking about, and solving, problems that arise from having to make choices in situations that are beyond an individual’s direct experience.  The abstract reasoning skills that are practiced in economics are highly valued where choosing efficiently in coordination with others is important. Everyone has to have the same basic problem-solving approach and economic training provides that.

Thus, in business, a major problem that companies face is to earn at least enough to cover their costs. That means they have to have people at managerial levels who are focused on increasing a company’s revenues or decreasing its cost.  And these people need to be able to operate on their own using a common framework so that their decisions are compatible with those of others in the company. In business, that common framework is the economic decision-making framework.

Similarly, in government, managers are required to achieve as much as they can with their limited budgets.  And, of course, economic consulting firms bring specialized skills in problem solving that are beyond the capabilities of individual companies or government agencies.
