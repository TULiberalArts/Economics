## The Economic Way of Thinking
Economics is a way of thinking that provides insights into all facets of our personal and professional lives, improving our understanding of the world and our own decision-making. This is invaluable in making sound decisions in any type of organization.

Economics is oriented around solving real-world problems—not merely memorizing facts. 

## Help Resolve the Social Problems of Our Time
