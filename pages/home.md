## The Economic Way of Thinking
Economics is a way of thinking that provides insights into all facets of our personal and professional lives, improving our understanding of the world and our own decision-making. This is invaluable in making sound decisions in any type of organization, and provides the foundation for many other academic and professional disciplines, such as management, marketing and finance. Economics is oriented around solving real-world problems — not merely memorizing facts.  

## Help Resolve the Social Problems of Our Time
The mission of the Department of Economics is to provide a program of study in economics that fosters the intellectual growth of our undergraduate and graduate students, cultivates a stimulating research environment for the faculty, enhances the scholarship of the University and contributes to the field of economics while employing the analytical tools of the discipline.
