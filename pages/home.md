Economics is a way of thinking that provides insights into all facets of our personal and professional lives, improving our understanding of the world and our own decision-making. 
Economics is oriented around solving real-world  problems — not merely memorizing facts. This helps to build valuable critical thinking skills and methods of analysis. 
The economic way of thinking is invaluable in  making sound decisions in any type of organization, and provides the foundation for many other academic and professional disciplines, such as management, marketing and finance. 

The Department of Economics provides a rigorous training that is valuable in the competitive labor market and a strong basis for graduate studies in business, law and the social sciences.

The Economics Department is home to more than 300 undergraduate majors, over 50 graduate students in the MA and Ph.D. Programs and over 20 full-time faculty members. The mission of the Department of Economics is to provide a program of study in economics that fosters the intellectual growth of our undergraduate and graduate students, cultivates a stimulating research environment for the faculty, enhances the scholarship of the University, contributes to the field of economics and employs the analytical tools of the discipline to help resolve the social problems of our time. Undergraduate students gain an understanding of economics that provides a foundation useful in further undergraduate and graduate study and in their careers. Graduate students gain in-depth knowledge that provides for professional success in academics, industry, and government. The Department strives for an environment that stimulates excellence in scholarship, teaching and service.

The study of economics is excellent preparation for a wide range of careers. Economics majors with bachelor’s degrees are well prepared to be managers and leaders in both the public and private sectors. Training in economics at the undergraduate level also provides a solid basis for professional study in law, business, public administration, and the health sciences. College graduates who majored in economics rank highly in terms of compensation nationally.

## Earnings of Economics Majors in Perspective

Your undergraduate major has a huge influence on your career. Our faculty member Douglas Webber has recently published research on the earnings of about 80 different college majors. The following two links present in PDF form estimates of the median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile earnings of people who have earned these majors. One table presents these statistics for people who receive a Bachelor’s degree but do not ever get a graduate degree of any type, and the other table includes everyone. At the bottom of each of these tables there is a short description of the method and the sample behind the table as well as a link to the paper by Dr. Webber. [Expected lifetime earnings](http://www.cla.temple.edu/economics/files/2014/04/Expected-lifetime-earnings-Only-Bachelors1-copy.pdf) (Only Bachelors).[Expected lifetime earnings](http://www.cla.temple.edu/economics/files/2014/04/Expected-lifetime-earnings-All1-copy.pdf) (All).

Also, data from the 2010 U.S. Census tells us that Economics majors have some of the best compensated careers. The table below shows a comparison of compensation data for a few selected majors, to put this claim in perspective. The data comes from the digital edition of the Wall Street Journal, November 14, 2011, and it is based on the report [What’s it Worth](http://cew.georgetown.edu/whatsitworth) by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.
