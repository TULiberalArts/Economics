The Department of Economics offers full-time and part-time graduate programs leading to master’s (MA) and doctoral (PhD) degrees. After completing the MA program, students have the technical skills required for economic analysis of business and public policy. After completing the PhD program, students are able to conduct original research and advance knowledge in the field.

**_Economics graduate programs are currently in abeyance as the department updates the structure of these programs. Please check back at a future date for more details._**

## Master of Arts in Economics
Economics master’s degree students can focus on a specific area of economics or follow a general course of study. Potential areas of specialization include: econometrics, financial economics, health economics, international monetary economics and labor economics. 

The program gives students an opportunity to specialize in one of two areas: (a) general economics or (b) applied economics and financial markets. The program is primarily dedicated to producing well-trained economics researchers and managers. Many students go on to enter PhD programs.

## PhD in Economics
The economics PhD prepares students for university teaching and research and for positions as economists in government, business and industry. The program emphasizes the development of advanced research and scholarship skills in applied economics areas. To accomplish this, the program has fields in econometrics, economic development, industrial organization, international economics, financial economics and labor economics. The program has a strong track record in placing its graduates in desirable positions.
