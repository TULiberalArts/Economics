The Department of Economics offers full-time and part-time graduate programs leading to master’s (MA) and doctoral (Ph.D.) degrees.

Please visit the [Economics Graduate Admissions page](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/admissions/graduate/economics) to learn more about graduate program requirements and instructions on how to apply.

## M.A. in Economics
Our master’s degree in economics helps students understand contemporary economic theory and its application to problems in industry, business and government. Students can focus on a specific area of economics or follow a general course of study. Potential areas of specialization include: econometrics, financial economics, health economics, international monetary economics and labor economics. The program provides specialized study and can serve as a terminal degree or a foundation for those who intend to apply to the PhD program.

The MA in Economics prepares the student to understand contemporary economic theory and its application to problems arising in industry, business, and government. The program gives the student an opportunity to specialize in one of two areas: (a) general economics or (b) applied economics and financial markets. The program is primarily dedicated to producing well-trained researchers and managers in the field of Economics. Many students go on to enter Ph.D. programs.

The Ph.D. in economics is designed to prepare the student for university teaching and research, and for positions as economists in government, business and industry. The program emphasizes the development of advanced research and scholarship skills in applied economics areas. To accomplish this, the program has fields in econometrics, economic development, industrial organization, international economics, financial economics, and labor economics. The program has a strong track record in placing its graduates in desirable positions.
